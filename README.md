# Pacman-Test
This assignment was designed to make PacMan eat and bounce back and forth on the screen in the X direction.
Downloads for this include Java kit developer and an interface that allows Java to be written
Future ways to expand this would be to add balls for PacMan to eat as he goes back and forth. This way it gets more and more like the game.
